👉 Here, in this console based charp/.Net application, we are using file system as a primary database where all the `CRUD` operation are performed.

<b>C : Create</b>

<b>R : Read</b>

<b>U : Update</b>

<b>D : Delete</b>

In this application, we are speciapply using `StreamReader` and `StreamWriter` to access the file and to perform certain file operations.

#### What does StreamReader and StreamWriter does ?

=> The StreamReader and StreamWriter classes are used for reading from and writing data to text files. These classes inherit from the abstract base class Stream, which supports reading and writing bytes into a file stream. ✅

#### What is the motive of the project ?

This is very simple, it's not an application that solve the big real woarld problem but it is the project that simply gives the understanding on, `how we can we operate any files 'text file' via the programs.`. It is useful, when we want to automatically write on the textfile on the server after when the certain request is processed or terminated.
